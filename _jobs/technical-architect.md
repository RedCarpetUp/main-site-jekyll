### Technical Architect

at RedCarpet

##### Delhi, India
We were looking for someone to join us as our Technology Architect and join us on this incredible adventure. 

we’re looking for someone with a strong architectural and hacker background and willing to stand their ground and fight for what they believe is best - but be able to be pleasant while dealing with people.  Any developer we hire will have to be a top-notch communicator. You will also understand the virtue of silence - and prefer to communicate over IRC over speaking (we're still working on telepathy).

Nobody will be looking over your shoulder while you work - so you will need to be capable of  raising a fuss early if something beyond your control is blocking the project. You will, however, not complain of the GIL more than once every 24 hours.

You will understand (or learn to understand) the difference between UX and UI and what personas are - yes, we expect our engineers to be part product managers.

A sense of humor is appreciated.

##### Qualifications
Some of the most incredible programmers I’ve known don’t have pretty resumes, so we have no “minimum” requirements for degrees. We’re also hyper-equal-opportunity: quality work knows no bounds for race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation,  or religion. If you love your work and breathe code, we’ll do amazing things together, no matter who, what, or where you are.

I dont want to put in a "years of experience" as a filter - but from a level of competency and maturity perspective, I am looking at a  4-6 yea###rs signaling.
