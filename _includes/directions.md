Our office is right across the road from Ambience Mall behind Lemontree Hotel.

The way to get there is simple:

1. Get on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway NH-8 and cross the toll. Make sure you are on the left side of the toll (the toll is actually divided into two - the left allows a u-turn, the right is mandatory straight)

2. Keep driving and you will see Ambience mall on the left.

3. You will see three u-turns on your right: the first is marked to go back to Delhi (skip this), the second is blocked (skip this), the third is marked for Trident/Oberoi hotel. Take the third.

4. After you take the u-turn, move to the left of the road - you will see two lanes going to the left: the first one is a small one curving back (skip this), the second is a big road on the left. Take this.

5. Now you are on the road that will pass Oberoi and Trident hotels on your left - as soon as you cross the hotels, take the left road.

6. Keep driving for 100 m till you see a Tata Consultancy Services building on your left and a ChargePoint (plot # 809) office on your right. Take the road in to chargepoint - park. Office building is opposite to Aspire Systems.


Alternatively, you can come via the metro: Change at Sikandarpur metro station to the Gurgaon Rapid Metro. The closest station to us is the Indusind Bank Cybercity Metro station. You
will need to cross the highway (!!), walk past the restaurant called "Toast Garden Lounge", cross a large ground and then come to our office. Its next to plot # 806
