### Our Point of View

We believe that everyone should have access to quality financial services, provided with dignity, transparency, and care. Founded in 2011, RedCarpet is focused on helping expand access and choice for many Americans who are financially underserved. Our goal is to provide credit-building opportunities for everyone because we’re invested in the long-term financial health of our customers. Others are starting to take note, which is perhaps why we were selected as one of the world’s top 10 most innovative companies in personal finance by [Fast Company.][fast_company]

We’ve supported the progress of our customers, many of whom started off with a $250 loan and, over time, have worked their way up to a $1000 credit-reporting loan. And we want to help more of our customers succeed. With our passion for expanding financial access, along with our combined expertise in software, data science, design, financial services, and education, we are on track to build the next generation of financial services. And we’re just getting started.
